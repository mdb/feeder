fixes issue #20 by correcting the `reader.CreateReader` logic determining whether to use a `reader.FileReader` or `reader.StdinReader`. Previously, in some environments (like GH Actions Ubuntu runners), `tf-summarize` incorrectly attempted to use a `reader.StdinReader`, even when an explicit filename argument is provided.\r\n\r\nIdeally, `tf-summarize` would feature automated tests through which I could prove the bug & fix. ~In absence of such tests,~ I added a `demo` GitHub Actions job proving `tf-summarize` continues to work. ~However, I'm happy to add real tests (either in this PR, or in a followup PR)~, if you prefer those, @dineshba (I'm also happy to remove the `demo` GH Actions job from this PR if you prefer it not clutter `.github/workflows/build.yml`).\r\n\r\n**Update:** I added 2 additional commits:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/dineshba/tf-summarize/pull/64/commits/40f8d1bd71529351c5b051a032fc5f3d646f0960 ensures the use of a consistent Terraform version when interacting with the `example` project\r\n* https://github.com/dineshba/tf-summarize/pull/64/commits/efdf4dbd5ff3364c0f39ed0f6bbb70c7ecba92df adds an automated test verifying the fix provided by this PR showing that `tf-summarize -md plan.json` and `cat plan.json | tf-summarize -md` both continue to work as expected.\r\n\r\nNote that https://github.com/dineshba/tf-summarize/pull/63 shows reproduction of the bug via a similar GitHub Actions-based demo.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize/issues/63","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize/issues/63/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize/issues/63/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dineshba/tf-summarize/issues/63/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dineshba/tf-summarize/pull/63","id":2080424812,"node_id":"PR_kwDOGq54_85kAjd_","number":63,"title":"Demo

This PR seeks to pitch you on an idea for a consolidated, optional `--repo` flag to replace the required `--owner`/`--repo` flags. Admittedly, though, the effort spun out a bit and required I layer in a bit of complexity, particularly surrounding testability. So, I'm not at all offended if you'd prefer not to merge this...I figured I'd at least pitch ya on the idea, though 😄 \r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis seeks to replace the previously-required `--owner`/`--repo` flags with a single, _optional_ `--repo` flag, whose value may be a `[HOST/]OWNER/REPO` string, where the `HOST/` part is optional, similar to the core `gh` CLI's `--repo` option (see `gh pr ls --help` for an example). In turn, this paves a path towards...\r\n\r\n* allowing `--repo` to be optional (if not specified, its value is automatically set to the value of the repo in the current working directory, similar to how core `gh` commands set the value)\r\n* enabling support for GitHub Enterprise instances hosted at non `github.com` URLs\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, this also ensures the command output is printed to whatever is set via `RootCmd.SetOut`, whereas previously the non-erroring command output was indiscriminately sent to `fmt.Println`, out of view of tests. Now, tests can invoke `RootCmd.SetOut` and successfully make assertions on the resulting output.\r\n\r\n## Downsides\r\n\r\n* This introduces a breaking change for users who assume distinct and required `--repo` and `--owner` flags\r\n* This introduces a bit of complexity you feel may not be worth it (more code, more logic, some new global `defaultStart` and `defaultEnd` variables to assist with testing, etc.)\r\n\r\n~Also note that while this seeks to make `gh-metrics`'s `--repo` option behave more like `gh`'s own `--repo` option, `gh-metrics` still uses a `-r` short flag whereas core `gh` uses a `-R`. Perhaps that could/should change too?~ Update: `gh-metrics` now uses the `-R` shorthand too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hectcastro/gh-metrics/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hectcastro/gh-metrics/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}],"yardbirdsax/aster":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yardbirdsax/aster/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yardbirdsax/aster","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yardbirdsax/aster/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yardbirdsax/aster/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yardbirdsax/aster/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/yardbirdsax/aster/pull/2","id":1517843679,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIsdo-85GkIrU","number":2,"title":"Some NOOP cleanup and a buggy test fix!","user":{"login":"mdb","id":184109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb","html_url":"https://github.com/mdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-01-03T19:48:36Z","updated_at":"2023-01-07T14:30:02Z","closed_at":"2023-01-07T14:30:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yardbirdsax/aster/pulls/2","html_url":"https://github.com/yardbirdsax/aster/pull/2","diff_url":"https://github.com/yardbirdsax/aster/pull/2.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/yardbirdsax/aster/pull/2.patch","merged_at":"2023-01-07T14:30:02Z"},"body":"👋 Hi @yardbirdsax - nice work here and happy new year!

few peripheral changes too:\r\n\r\n* Additionally, GitHub Actions CI/CD now invokes `make` as the standard entry for verifying code quality across both local dev and CI/CD\r\n* Formatting and code quality tweaks surfaced as necessary by the new `vet` and `test-fmt` Make targets\r\n* The removal of some excess trailing whitespace in GitHub Actions YML config files\r\n\r\n### DEVELOPER IMPACT\r\n\r\nWhile this doesn't change the source code or package interface in any material way, maintainers can now use `make` during

I am also imagining that it paves a path towards a future where `terraform-provider-vinyldns` and `vinyldns-cli` can set custom `UserAgent`s such that usage statistics can be gleaned from logs.\r\n\r\n* `Client{}` now has a `UserAgent` field\r\n* `NewClientFromEnv()` will either look for a `VINYLDNS_USER_AGENT` env var or set `UserAgent` to `fmt.Sprintf(\"go-vinyldns %s\", Version)`\r\n* `go-vinyldns` now has a `Version`\r\n* a `make validate-version` task errors if the `go-vinyldns/version.go`'s `var Version =` is not equal to the `VERSION` cited in the `Makefile`. While not ideal, it seems necessary to cite the version in two places such that 1) `make` can generate versioned releases and 2) `go-vinyldns` can include the version in a default `client.UserAgent`\r\n* bump `go-vinyldns` patch version.

in source code -- this is the most simple, minimal change to make the messaging consistent.\r\n\r\n## Release Note\r\n\r\n* `set_pipeline` now prints \"no changes to apply\" and thereby behaves

What does this PR accomplish?\r\n\r\nThis PR seeks to address issue #6111 by preventing a `runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` when `set_pipeline` is run with a `file:` whose YML contains unexpected content.\r\n\r\n## Changes proposed by this PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to prevent the runtime error in the most minimal way possible by _only_ attempting to invoke `pipeline.SetParentIDs(step.metadata.JobID, step.metadata.BuildID)` _if_ a pipeline is found by `team.Pipeline(pipelineRef)`, in effect avoiding a scenario where `pipeline` doesn't exist and where `pipeline.SetParentIDs()` causes a runtime error.\r\n\r\nOne could imagine other solutions, such as perhaps improved [configvalidate#Validate](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/atc/configvalidate/validate.go#L25) functionality to protect against this. However, the solution implemented in this PR aspires to be a simple first pass at fixing the problem with a minimal code change.\r\n\r\n## Notes to reviewer:\r\n\r\nThis fix can be verified by running `docker-compose up --build` against this code and `fly set-pipeline`-ing the following pipeline...\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nresource_types:\r\n\r\n- name: git-ubuntu\r\n  type: registry-image\r\n  source:\r\n    repository: concourse/git-resource\r\n    tag: ubuntu\r\n\r\nresources:\r\n\r\n- name: gist\r\n  type: git-ubuntu\r\n  source:\r\n    uri: https://gist.github.com/ac6ae0980b268ae5ff2449fef3ab87c5.git\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n\r\n- name: update-pipeline-with-task-yml\r\n  plan:\r\n  - get: gist\r\n  - set_pipeline: bad-pipeline\r\n    file: gist/task.yml\r\n\r\n- name: update-pipeline-with-empty-yml\r\n  plan:\r\n  - get: gist\r\n  - set_pipeline: bad-pipeline\r\n    file: gist/empty.yml\r\n\r\n- name: update-pipeline-with-valid-yml\r\n  plan:\r\n  - get: gist\r\n  - set_pipeline: good-pipeline\r\n    file: gist/valid-pipeline.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `update-pipeline-with-task-yml` and `update-pipeline-with-empty-yml` should not result in newly-set `bad-pipeline` pipelines. Running `update-pipeline-with-valid-yml` _should_ result in a newly-set `good-pipeline`.\r\n\r\n## Release Note\r\n\r\n* `set_pipeline` of a YML pipeline configuration file with no `jobs:` or `resources:` no longer causes a `runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`.\r\n\r\n## Contributor Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Followed [Code of conduct], [Contributing Guide] & avoided [Anti-patterns]\r\n- [X] [Signed] all commits\r\n- [X] Added tests (Unit and/or Integration)\r\n- [ ] Updated [Documentation]\r\n- [ ] Added release note (Optional)\r\n\r\n[Code of Conduct]: https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\r\n[Contributing Guide]: https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n[Anti-patterns]: https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Anti-Patterns\r\n[Signed]: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits\r\n[Documentation]: https://github.com/concourse/docs\r\n\r\n## Reviewer Checklist\r\n<!--\r\nThis section is intended for the reviewers only, to track review\r\nprogress.\r\n-->\r\n- [ ] Code reviewed\r\n- [ ] Tests reviewed\r\n- [ ] Documentation reviewed\r\n- [ ] Release notes reviewed\r\n- [ ] PR acceptance performed\r\n- [ ] New config flags added?

This is a bit of a long shot -- and I completely understand if you'd rather not do this -- but this PR seeks to build the [terraform-provider-vinyldns](https://github.com/vinyldns/terraform-provider-vinyldns) into `ljfranklin/terraform-resource` such that users don't need to download it separately.\r\n\r\nThe context is...\r\n\r\nMy organization runs a very large Concourse installation serving thousands of developers. Your `ljfranklin/terraform-resource` is very popular and is in use throughout users' pipelines. However, because many, many pipelines _also_ make use of the [terraform-provider-vinyldns](https://github.com/vinyldns/terraform-provider-vinyldns), it's necessary for users to download and install the `terraform-provider-vinyldns` plugin on execution of each job that utilizes it, which tasks the pipelines in doing a lot of perhaps-avoidable work. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- name: terraform-apply\r\n  serial: true\r\n  plan:\r\n  - in_parallel:\r\n    - get: source\r\n    # a github-release-resource instance:\r\n    - get: terraform-provider-vinyldns\r\n    # a task that copies the terraform-provider-vinyldns and .tf files to a shared location\r\n  - task: install-tf-plugins\r\n    file: source/ci/tasks/install_tf_plugins.yml\r\n  - put: terraform\r\n    params:\r\n      terraform_source: tf-src-and-plugins\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore forking your resource (thanks again for all your hard work on it!), I figure I'd _at least_ open this pull request to gauge your feelings (But, as I said, I completely understand if you'd rather not merge it).\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ljfranklin/terraform-resource/issues/109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ljfranklin/terraform-resource/issues/109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}],"concourse/resource-types":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concourse/resource-types/issues/23","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concourse/resource-types","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concourse/resource-types/issues/23/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concourse/resource-types/issues/23/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/concourse/resource-types/issues/23/events","html_url":"https://github.com/concourse/resource-types/pull/23","id":550508706,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzYzNDAzNDg0","number":23,"title":"add

Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis seeks to configure a default `rake` task which runs the RSpec tests, as well as to wire up the configuration for TravisCI continuous integration.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nWhile other CI systems exist, TravisCI is one of the more popular, widely used, and easy to integrate amongst open source projects.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In The Gem?\r\n\r\nContinuous integration works to help automate quality insurance as changes are introduced to the gem.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nBy configuring a default `rake` task and TravisCI CI, contributors and users are able to easily view the gem's build status, and also to easily understand how best to validate their own contributions and changes.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThis will require that TravisCI integration be enabled and maintained. Further changes may be necessary down the road pending how this performs in TravisCI, though I presently have no visibility until TravisCI is wired up.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nI validated that the following installs gems and runs tests; this is presumably the same action TravisCI takes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\nbundle exec rake\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues (Optional)\r\n\r\nPresently, the tests appear to assume the presence of an environment variable which, when absent, causes test failures, IIUC:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAn error occurred while loading
